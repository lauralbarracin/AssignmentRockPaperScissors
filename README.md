# Virtual Rock Paper Scissors Game!

A virtual version of Rock Paper Scissors! 
It has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. is a traditional game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously choose one of three weapons "rock", "paper", and "scissors".

A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie

This version gives each player three lives. The game concludes once a player loose all lives or if he/she decides to quit.

## Knowledge Reflection
Learning something about Python is completaly new for me. However, the process was hard but everytime I complete one step of this project I feel so happy. It shows me that everyday we can learn something new.
